# DenseNet169StackingANNVMLR
The purpose of this study is to classify bone marrow changes in the lumbar vertebrae using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and evaluate the effectiveness of a proposed hybrid model for accurate diagnosis. Bone marrow changes in the lumbar spine are commonly associated with various conditions, including degenerative diseases, chronic low back pain (CLBP), and other pathological processes. Accurate identification of these changes is crucial for early diagnosis and appropriate treatment planning

Traditional methods of analyzing MRI scans are often time-consuming and prone to subjective interpretation. Therefore, there is a need for automated, robust, and efficient techniques to improve diagnostic accuracy. In response to this need, we propose a hybrid model that leverages DenseNet169 as a feature extractor, followed by a stacking ensemble of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Logistic Regression (LR) classifiers. The model, named DenseNet169StackingANNVMLR, aims to enhance classification performance by combining the strengths of these machine learning techniques.

This study investigates the classification performance of the DenseNet169StackingANNVMLR model for detecting and categorizing bone marrow changes in the lumbar vertebrae using MRI data. By employing advanced deep learning and machine learning techniques, we aim to develop a reliable, automated system that could support radiologists and clinicians in diagnosing bone marrow abnormalities with higher precision.
